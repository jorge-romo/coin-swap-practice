# Matisse Swap App
This app resembles decentralized crypto swap tools like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)

I built it using TypeScript, React, Next.js & Material UI


## Points to finish
- ~~Created the tab functionality~~
- ~~"Connect Adress" functionality~~
- ~~Implement onChange functionality for amount field with its conditions~~
- ~~The "toggle" button functionality~~
- ~~"Swap" button styling~~
- ~~Update card info~~
- ~~Mobile View !!~~
- Developer CurrencySelectionField view for mobile 
- Tabs Style
- Currency & Amount fields styling

## Points that still need imporvment/development
- The icon position for currency selection field
- Using MUI Themes instead of statis attributes to standarize the colors & typography
- The Tab bar color & style
- The Max button for entering maximum fund value
